<p>
Learning to use Java when coming from the C/C++ Realm.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
It has the JVM

<ul>
<li>
This has both advantage sadn disadavantages but it allows for some
      interesting things, like, catch all segfaults, inspect/modify the
      structure of a class during runtime (e.g., get the name of a method /
      class etc.), reflections etc.

</ul>
<li>
All methods are always virtual -&gt; runtime overhead

<li>
There's a package scope in class methods and variables. This helps during
  package testing and to give developers certain priorities

<li>
You can't have standalone functions, they should be static functions inside
  a class... not that conventient.

<li>
I want to know the size of a non-primitive data type in Java:

<ul>
<li>
The designers' view is that it is not needed in Java, since the language
    removes the need for an application to know about how much space needs to be
    reserved for a primitive value, an object or an array with a given number of
    elements.  You might think that a sizeof operator would be useful for people
    that need to know how much space their data structures take. However you can
    also get this information and more, simply and reliably using a Java memory
    profiler, so there is no need for a sizeof method.

<li>
Well, that's kind of shitty...

<li>
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2370288/is-there-any-sizeof-like-method-in-java">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2370288/is-there-any-sizeof-like-method-in-java</a>

</ul>
<li>
Not as expressive as C++. No support for overloads, or defining loose types
  with <code>typedef</code>/<code>using</code>.

<li>
<code>POJO</code> stands for <code>Plain Old Java Object</code>

<ul>
<li>
It's the equivalent of <code>POD</code> in C++

</ul>
<li>
<code>DTO</code> Data Transfer Object

<ul>
<li>
It is used when we want to pass <em>data with multiple attributes in one shot from client to server</em>.
    Transfer Object is a simple POJO class having getter/setter methods and is
    <code>serialized</code> so that it can be transferred over the network.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Java developers seem to give too much attention to the IDE they're using.
  Their IDE is not only about editing Java code, but a tool to build their code,
  maybe deploy it, interact with Git, etc. I mean, that's not necessarily bad,
  but at some point you start to overly depend on that sh*t and realise you
  can't type a single command on the terminal or you don't know what commands
  are actually used to build your code.
