<p>
It can trick your mind into feeling less tired during a workout, and also help
to encourage positive thoughts.
</p>

<p>
While listening to music will no doubt mask some outside noises, an Australian
study found that a cyclist wearing ear-bud style headphones and playing music at
a reasonable volume hears much more outside noise than a car driver — even when
that driver has no music playing.
</p>

<p>
So evidence suggests it is possible to cycle safely with headphones, once the
cyclist is sure they are still aware of their surroundings.
</p>

<p>
This is a sentiment shared by British Cycling: “It’s best to use all your senses
while riding a bike but your hearing is far less important than your sight,”
said a spokesperson for the organisation.
</p>

<p>
“People who are deaf can ride perfectly safely while on the road. In the end we
should all be looking out for each other.”
