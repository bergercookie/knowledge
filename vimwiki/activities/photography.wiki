* Sunstar formation factors:
    * The pointiness of the sunstar depends on how *straight your aperture blades are* (that's a lens thing)
    * The *number of rays depends on the number of aperture blades in your lens* (2n if n % 2 == 0 or n if n % 2 == 1)
    * Then you need to stop down quite a lot (to f11 or f16 on my lens on full-frame)
    * And you need some very specular light. This can be achieved by partially hiding the sun or just shoot at night, then most lamps on the street will do this
