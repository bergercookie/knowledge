== Riding a bike and listening to music ==

It can trick your mind into feeling less tired during a workout, and also help
to encourage positive thoughts.

While listening to music will no doubt mask some outside noises, an Australian
study found that a cyclist wearing ear-bud style headphones and playing music at
a reasonable volume hears much more outside noise than a car driver — even when
that driver has no music playing.

So evidence suggests it is possible to cycle safely with headphones, once the
cyclist is sure they are still aware of their surroundings.

This is a sentiment shared by British Cycling: “It’s best to use all your senses
while riding a bike but your hearing is far less important than your sight,”
said a spokesperson for the organisation.

“People who are deaf can ride perfectly safely while on the road. In the end we
should all be looking out for each other.”
