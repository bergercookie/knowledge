== Endgame tactics: ==

1. Don't rush
2. Activate your king
3. Rooks belong *behind panws*
   Both when attacking and defending


=== Hints ===

* *Skewer* the king and rook in the endgame!!

* "rook-pawn" and wrong colored bishop -> Opponent can get draw if they can block the "rook-pawn"

* If you end up with `King` and `Pawn` *do not separate them!!* the Rook will eat it

=== King-pawn endings ===

*DIRECT OPPOSITION* of your king with the opponent's

* When the opponent has the pawn:
    * `do not` take your king off the passed pawn file
* When you have the pawn:
    * You have to move your king in front of the pawn *by two squares*
    * In order to advance your pawn to one-before-promotion  square, you have to
      do this `without check`
* When you do have direct opposition as white, and your king is in front by two
  squares, *push the pawn forward*

*DISTANT OPPOSITION*

You want your king to end up at the same file as the opposite King and with an
odd number of squares between them *to draw*; regardless of whether you have the
pawn or not

*King Triangulation Movement*

=== King-Rook-Pawn endings ===

* Lucena endgame - attack as white
    * Rf4 - building a bridge
* Philidor position - defend as black
    * Third rank defence
    * Keep the rook on the third rank until the opponent pushes the pawn forward
