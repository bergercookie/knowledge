== TODO ==

* Buy a proper microphone
* Start using beamer?
    * Be fast with it
    * auto-refresh -> [[https://github.com/pwmt/zathura|zathura]]
    * Animations?
    * Add templates (e.g., first slide)
* Different background for every slide?
* Find beamer-enabled docker container

== Hints ==

* Sum up your presentation to *up to 5 points*
  Put them to a slide *both* at the beginning and at the end
* Take a video of you *multiple times* before the presentation!!
  How do you look?
  Anything to improve?
* Ask members of the audience after your talk (privately) or friends of yours
  before your presentation *what points they remember*, or *what slides were
  interesting!* If they don't remember or say something vague, then you've
  failed!

== Phrases ==

* Welcome to my talk
