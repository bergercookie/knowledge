= Logging and Analyzing Logs in Linux =

== Options ==

* Standard `syslog`
* `journald`
* `multitail` (for viewing multiple different files on your system)

== syslog ==

* If you want to send logs from CLI to `syslog` you do it via `logger`

== `journald` / `journalctl` ==

* If you want to send logs from CLI to `journald` you do it via `systemd-cat`
    * It's the equivalent of `logger` on `syslog`
    * Whatever goes to `syslog` is also getting logged to `journald`
* https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-journalctl-to-view-and-manipulate-systemd-logs
    * Very good crash course


== `systemd-cat` vs `logger` ==

I would stick with logger: it works with any standards-compliant logging system,
including systemd’s journal as you’ve discovered. Using systemd-cat directly
would only make your scripts systemd-specific, without adding anything; in fact,
modern logger is much more flexible, and provides better support for
systemd-specific features than systemd-cat itself.
