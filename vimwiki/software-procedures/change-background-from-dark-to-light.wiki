= Change Background/Colorscheme from Dark to Light in your dev environment =

A must-have if working with your laptop outdoors, with the sun hitting directly
on your screen

Make changes in the following places:

* `colorscheme` in `vimrc` - use `:colorscheme<TAB>` to experiment interactively
* Airline theme in `vimrc` - Use `:AirlineTheme<TAB>` to experiment
* `:set background=light` in Vim.
* colours section in `alacritty.yml` - Put it in `{{{ ... }}}` for easy fold
  unfold when editing with Vim
* i3 colors section
  NOTE: Color management and switching is not really maintainable in i3, should
  either skip this altogether, or find a plugin / another way of doing it.
* BG in tmux (No real need for this in the end)
