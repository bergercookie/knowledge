= radio =

* RF Signal Strength - Intensity: `W / m^2`.
  * Strength goes down faster, the further away you get from the transmitter

=== Regarding different WiFi Frequencies ===

* 2.4GHz WiFi has 11 channels
* 5.0GHz WiFi has 23 channels

* 2.4GHz is in ISM band
    * Does not require FCC validation - unlicensed
    * Most commercial devices out there talk over this frequency - too many
      collisions when talking in this frequency
    * Microwaves and cordless phones are also at 2.45 GHz, adding to the noise

=== AM vs FM ===

* AM is more noisy than FM
  * AM receives and translates differences in amplitude directly, thus any
    interference in that amplitude will cause noise
  * FM doesn't care about amplitude so it amplifies the signal a lot during
    transmission so that any noise cannot alter the zero-crossing of the signal
    so, additive noise gets skimmed off.


=== Regarding radio towers ===

Towers are triangular  and their signals can overlap with other towers over the
same channels. Hence towers broadcast to different channels in different
directions so that they don't interfere with each that of the other tower(s).
