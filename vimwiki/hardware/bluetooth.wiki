= Bluetooth Protocol and Implementations =

Bluetooth implementations have lots of security holes

* Identify vulnerable digital speakers -> Play sounds
* BLE/AirDrop case: [[https://www.wired.com/story/airdrop-leaking-email-addresses-and-phone-numbers/|Recover one's phone number]]
* The original bluetooth protocol (not BLE) is 3k pages long! Super hard to
  implement as a vendor
* Bluetooth gets its name and symbol from King Harald Blatand of Norway and
  Denmark, (KHB in runic alphabet)

    * The concept is that King Harald "connected" Norway and Denmark, Bluetooth
      connects computers?!
* Motorola was the first major provider to integrate bluetooth in their devices, around ~2000s
  * This gave it a major boost
* 3 classes of Bluetooth when it comes to range:
  * ~100m - requires external power supply
  * ~10m - used in bluetooth phones
  * ~1m - BLE Protocol

== Bluetooth software implementations ==

Each Linux distro has its own bluetooth implementation

* BSD has `netgraph`
* Linux has `BlueZ`, made by Qualcomm, ,kernel >= `2.4.6`
  * ++ `dfu` - device firmware upgrade
* Android has `BlueDroid` / `Fluoride`

== Bluetooth Protocol and Implementation ==

Many different protocols are called Bluetooth:

* `BR` - Basic Rate
* `EDR` - Enhanced Data Rate

=== Features ===

* Bluetooth 4.0: <= 25Mbps
* WiFi Direct: <= 250Mbps
* Packet-based
* Master-Slave architecture
* 2.400 - 2.4835 GHz
* Bluetooth devices declare *profiles* that they are compatible with.
    * There's no limitation in the accessible profiles!
        * Headphones may declare they are routers!
* It's implementation is ~3000p long, or 5000p long with consumer related items
  included
* Lots of undefined behavior even with this number of pages!
* BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) is a much better protocol. It's official name is
  `Bluetooth 4.0`

== Various ==

* _Guard Band_: A part between two radio bands that's unused to prevent
  interferences
