Certainly not in descending order; Rather a non-exhaustive list of artists and
paintings I've overly enjoyed watching

1. Salvador Dali
2. Picasso
3. Matthias Gr√ºnewald
    1. The Temptations of St. Anthony
4. Jean Francois Millet - The Angelus
5. Vincent Van Gogh
    1. Portrait of Dr. Gachet
    2. The Olive Trees
6. Sandro Botticelli
7. Parmigianino
    1. Madonna with the Long Neck: A great example of the _"Mannerist"_ movement
       in High Renaissance art. _Mannerism_ makes itself known by elongated

9. Jacques-Luis David
    1. The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries (1812)

    1. Napoleon in the Penthouse at Jaffa (1804)
11. Leonardo Da-Vinci
    1. St. John the Baptist
12. Bruegel the Elder
    1. Triumph of Death (1562)
