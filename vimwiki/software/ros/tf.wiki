== Implementation of TF suitable in Micro-ROS ==

One persistent issue with transform graphs has been their resource use. `ROS TF
works through replicated copies of the entire transform tree at every node that
uses it, and is implemented through unicast TCP connections between nodes`. In
systems with many dynamic parts, this has sometimes been called the `TF
firehose`, because of the large stream of incoming messages. micro-ROS will go
beyond this state of the art by running the dynamic transform tree in an
embedded device, while keeping resource use to a minimum based on an analysis
of the spatial and temporal details actually necessary. Further, enabling
real-time queries even in the face of concurrent updates through integration
will be realized through integration with the micro-ROS real-time executor. It
is also planned to integrate the embedded TF will with the node lifecycle to
achieve further power-savings
