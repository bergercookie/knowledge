== Use multimaster_fkie ==

Link: http://wiki.ros.org/multimaster_fkie

=== Install ===

{{{sh
apt install ros-melodic-master-discovery-fkie  ros-melodic-master-sync-fkie
}}}

=== Use ===

On each machine, run:

{{{sh
rosrun master_discovery_fkie master_discovery& rosrun master_sync_fkie master_sync
}}}


== Use ROS_MASTER_URI ==

Each one of the ROS hosts involved should know each other ROS host by name. This
can be accomplished either by a dedicated DNS server in the network, e.g.,
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnsmasq|dnsmasq]] or by adding the appropriate
DNS entries in each machine's `/etc/hosts` file. If we're working with two
computers, named `AAA` and `BBB`, then:

* Add an entry with the IP of `AAA` in `/etc/hosts` of `BBB`
* Add an entry with the IP of `BBB` in `/etc/hosts` of `AAA`

To verify that the above works, you should be able to ping each machine from
each other machine by their hostname.

* In the computer that will serve as the master, launch a `roscore`
* In the other computer(s) you have to export the following variable, pointing
  to the DNS name of the computer serving as master. In our case, the master is
  `AAA`, so we're adding a line like the following in the `.bashrc` of `BBB`.
  * `export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://AAA:1131`


After that's in place, you can verify that you can see all the topics and nodes
active in `AAA` by running `rostopic list` or `rosnode list` from a shell in
`BBB`.
