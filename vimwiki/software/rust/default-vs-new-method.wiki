= Default vs New Method of a struct =

:rust:
:programming:

While Rust provides a `Default` trait for specifying the moral equivalent of a
default constructor, *it's incredibly rare for this trait to be used*. This is
because variables aren't implicitly initialized. Default is basically only
useful for generic programming.

In concrete contexts, `a type will provide a static new method for any kind of
"default" constructor`. This has no relation to new in other languages and has
no special meaning. It's just a naming convention.
