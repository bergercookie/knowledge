You can pattern match on slice patterns: https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/slice-patterns.html

Use syntax like the following:

{{{rust
fn greet(people: &[&str]) {
    match people {
        [] => println!("Bummer, there's no one here :("),
        [only_one] => println!("Hey, there {}! You seem to be alone.", only_one),
        [first, second] => println!(
            "Hello, {} and {}. Nice to see you are exactly 2!",
            first, second
        ),
        _ => println!("Hey everyone, we seem to be {} here today.", people.len()),
    }
}
}}}

OR

{{{rust
assert_eq!("ends with 3", match arr {
    [_, _, 3] => "ends with 3",
    [a, b, c] => "ends with something else",
});
}}}
