= Upload to PyPI =

_Update_: Now pypi uses API tokens to push packages to it!

----

Example: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/
Deploy to Pypi from travis: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pypi/

{{{sh
# From the root of repository
# Generate package
pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel twine
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
}}}

To upload (and then verify) to *test.pypi*:
{{{sh
# Push & pull back down again
twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
pip3 install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps <pkg-name>
}}}

To upload to *production* pypi
{{{sh
# Push & pull back down again
twine upload dist/*
pip3 install --no-deps <pkg-name>
}}}

*WARNING:* You have to bump the version before deploying!
