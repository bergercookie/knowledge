== Running headless on ARM ==

* You have to explicitly install matplotlib
    * Doing this from source on ARM is a massive PITA
    * Use the apt packages instead
* You have to setup `$DISPLAY` before executing

== Common issues ==

* Unrealistically high CPU usage numbers
    * I'm not sure exactly how this was caused, but including the forked
      children solved it for me. A command line like the following works fine: `psrecord --interval 0.1 --include-children PID --log logfile.log --plot plot.png`
