`.pyc` files are created by the Python interpreter when a .py file is imported.
They contain the "compiled bytecode" of the imported module/program so that the
"translation" from source code to bytecode (which only needs to be done once)
can be skipped on subsequent imports if the `.pyc` is newer than the corresponding
.py file, thus speeding startup a little.
