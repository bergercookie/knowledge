= Iterators vs Generators =

Got the answer from SO (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56544823/whats-the-difference-between-mypy-iterators-and-generators).

Notice that:

* Iterators only have two methods: __next__ and __iter__ but generators have many more.
* Generators are a subtype of Iterators -- every single Generator is also an Iterator, but not vice-versa.

But what does this mean on a high-level?

Well, in short, with iterators, the flow of information is `one-way only`. When
you have an iterator, all you can really do call the `__next__` method to get the
very next value to be yielded.

In contrast, the flow of information with generators is `bidirectional`: you can
send information back into the generator via the `send` method.

That's what the other two type parameters are for, actually -- when you do
Generator[A, B, C], you're stating that the values you yield are of type A, the
values you send into the generator are of type B, and the value that you return
from the generator are of type C.
