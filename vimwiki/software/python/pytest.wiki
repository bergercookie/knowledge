= Pytest Testing Suite =

* Skip a unittest
    * `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="Not Implemented")`
* Run a test by keyword expression: `pytest -k "MyClass and not method"`

    * This  will  run  tests  which  contain  names  that  match the given
      string expression, which can include Python operators that use filenames,
      class names and function names as variables.  The example above will run
      `TestMyClass.test_something`  but not `TestMyClass.test_method_simple`

* See all printing statements - force pytest to dump all output: `pytest -s`
