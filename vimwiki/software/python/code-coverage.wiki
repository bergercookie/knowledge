= Code Coverage =

Two options:

- codacy
- codecov

== Python ==

* use coverage.py + codacy to upload for github badge

    `pip3 install --user coverage codacy-coverage`
    run using your code: `coverage.py run <your program> <arg1> <arg2> ...`


* To run it on your unittests and have the report include only your own sources:
    * `coverage run -m unittest`
      you DONT need a unittest runner script
    * `coverage run --source <top-level-module> -m unittest`

It doesn't work?
    * Make sure you 've installed coverage for *Python3!*
