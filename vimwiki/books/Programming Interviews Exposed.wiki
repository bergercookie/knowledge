== Chapter 4 ==

* What the interviewer wants is to see *your thought processes* as you work
  through each stage of the programming problem -> *Speak your mind up* as you
  code.
* When you begin solving a problem, *don’t start writing code immediately*.
  First, make sure you completely understand the problem. It may help to work
  through a simple, concrete example and then try to generalize the process to
  an algorithm.  When you’re convinced you have the right algorithm, explain it
  clearly. Writing the code should be one of your final steps
* Make sure you *understand the problem before you start solving it*, and then
  *start with an example to solidify your understanding*.
* Try an example, and check all error and special cases.

== When you get stuck ==

* Go back to an example
* Try a different data structure
* Consider the less commonly used or more advanced aspects of a language

----

* Timings are with regards to *Best*, *Average*, and *Worst* cases.
