* Dolores, Bernard, etc. gain self-awareness, lose their blissful ignorance,
  only to be rolled back by Ford
* Love is meaningless, without the power of choosing to love
    * True love only comes from a being capable of not loving
    * Love and obedience, if coerced are meaningless
* Can free will exist in a world where god is all-knowing and all-powerful?
* What does it mean to live ethically when these choices wre made in advance by
  your maker?
* In WestWorld, if the fact that hosts' predetermined loops define them as
  automatons, then free will anchors their claim to conciousness `(*)`
* The condition for ethics in WestWorld is the ability to do right and wrong
    * You can't be evil when there are no stakes (i.e., William murdering Mave
      and her daughter)
